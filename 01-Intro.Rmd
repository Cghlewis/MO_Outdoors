# About this book {#intro}

All parks in included in this book will be categorized into the 6 regional areas, denoted by [DNR regional offices](https://dnr.mo.gov/regions/), that make up the state of Missouri. Each of those regions will be a chapter.  

1. Orange: West

3. Purple: North
4. Light blue: Central
5. Yellow: Southeast
6. Blue: East

All parks are rated on 7 criteria using a 5 point system (1=lowest rating; 5=highest rating). This can help readers easily get a snapshot if the park is right for them. However, not everything can be summed up in a rating system so each park will also include further description of why those ratings were given as well as images of the park if one is available.


**Criterion used in rating system:**

|Criterion               |Description                                                         |

|Beauty                  |This includes natural beauty, cleanliness and uniqueness of the site|
|Uncrowded               |We prefer less crowds, so more crowded/popular equals lower rating  |
|Ease of navigation      |This refers to trail confusion, will you get lost IN the park       |
|Toddler friendly trails |Difficult terrain, poorly maintained trail, etc. equals low rating  |
|Dogs allowed            |Are dogs legally allowed in the park? Is it dog friendly?           |
|Camping options         |Are there options for car or primitive camping? Yurts/cabins?       |
